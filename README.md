# motion_webmonitor

If you are using motion with one or more Raspberry Pi (or whatever) to monitor your home, you should have noticed that
the web interface is really not great (there isn't even HTTPS). The objective is therefore to make it possible to use
a "normal" web interface in order to manage one or more cameras.

### How to install ?

```
go build
./motion_webmonitor
```
